### How to run the app
The external libraries are installed in the project with SPM, so just pressing play should run the project correctly.

### Architecture
This app was made in MVVM. In MVVM, we are able to have a clean ViewController by maintaining it's logic in a ViewModel, which sends streams of information back to the ViewController by completion handlers.' The architecture follows the following Layers:
* Model (```Species```, ```SpeciesDetails```, ```EvolutionChain```)
* View (```DetailsViewController```,```ListViewController```, ```EvolutionInfoView```)
* ViewModel (```DetailsViewModel```,```ListViewModel```)
* Network (```RequestHandler```)

### Dependencies
* [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint): tool to enforce Swift style and conventions. Helps devs with small styleguide conventions that are usually forgotten.
* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire): Networking made easier than using URLSession
* [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher): Image loading/caching with 1 line of code. It also has placeholder features.

### What would I have done if I had more time?
* Repository Layer: It's job is to know where to fetch information from: Cache or Backend, for example
* Coordinator: it's job is to coordinate VC's presentation.
* Custom Swiftlint rules
* Better Pagination
* Nicer Error handling
* Remove hardcoded values

### Why did I change the project?
The project given wasn't finding simulators for some reason. After a few StackOverflow failed attempts, I decided to create a new project and move all the files to a new one. I don't think I changed much of the organization, besides creating the ViewModels, making the models Codable and creating a tableview extension.
